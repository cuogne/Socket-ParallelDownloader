To connect a server running on one laptop to a client running on another laptop, you need to ensure they're on the same network and modify the client code to use the server laptop's IP address. Here's a breakdown:

1. Network Configuration:

Same Network: Both laptops must be connected to the same local network, either via Wi-Fi or a wired Ethernet connection. Being on the same network allows them to communicate directly.

Check Firewall: Ensure that the server laptop's firewall isn't blocking incoming connections on the port you're using (9876 in this case). You might need to add a firewall rule to allow this traffic.

2. Determine Server IP:

On the server laptop:

Command Prompt/Terminal (Windows/macOS/Linux): The most reliable way is to use the ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (macOS/Linux) command in a terminal or command prompt. 
Look for the IPv4 address associated with your network adapter (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). It will typically look like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x.

3. Modify Client Code:

In your client code, change the HOST variable to the server's IP address you obtained in step 2. 
Don't use socket.gethostname() on the client side, as this will resolve to the client's hostname, not the server's.
